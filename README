More detailed installation instructions:
========================================

Windows:

First install Java, then the Apache Ant build tool for Java.  As part
of this you need to set the ANT_HOME and PATH environment variables on
your system appropriately. See this tutorial https://youtu.be/zmuMAHa8r2g

Then, enter the HexGUI project folder in the Terminal, noting that
there is a "build.xml" file, and here run the command-line command
"ant". This builds the project. You can now find the runnable .jar
Java program in the lib folder for HexGUI.
